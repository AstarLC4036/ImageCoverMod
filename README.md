# Image Cover Mod
A mod to load image into build scene.

# About add images.
- Put the image file you want to load in the Images directory inside the mod folder (PNG only. If the image you want to load is of JPG type, then I recommend finding some online conversion websites to convert it to PNG to use)

- The mod supports multi-image now. You can see all the available images on the image loading menu inside the mod, and you can click the reload button to reload them.

# Tips
Right click to show the image settings gui.
Comment about settings menu.
